# Personal Finance Manager

## Application Description

**The Personal Finance Manager** is an application used to track _in-flow_ and _out-flow_ of personal finance to help users make informed decisions.
Since most people including me have both _variable_ (free lance jobs etc.) and _fixed income_ (salary) as well as _variable_ costs (monthly item purchases or utility bill.)
and _fixed_ costs (rent and subscription etc.), we need something to **track** and **analyze** the flow of money. Since our bank account _does not reflect_ what we can _actually_ afford, we need an detailed report of our net income before splurging on an item. Additionally, the app can include a **tracker** to help us achieve our savings goals.

### User Stories:
