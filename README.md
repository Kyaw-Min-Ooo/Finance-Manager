# Finance Manager

## Program Description

**Finance Manager** is a program used to track a user's _income_ and _costs/spendings_ to help make informed financial decisions.
The program adds three neat features to your 'bank account' to build healthy financial habits such as spending **within budget**, avoiding **impulsive** purchases, and **reviewing** your monthly spending patterns.
This program can be used by anyone but it will be most useful to students with limited budget that has to make the most out of their budget to navigate college life full of expenses.
I personally splurge sometimes and tend to forget my goals so a program like this would help me build strong and healthy financial habits.

#### Budget Sergeant

This feature acts like your financial drill sergeant. Since our bank account balance _does not reflect_ what we can _actually_ afford, we need an the Budget Sergeant to check our saving goals, budget limits, and monthly payments due (Netflix, utilities bill etc.) with regards to your monthly income to ensure you can _really_ afford the purchase. This ensures the user stay **within budget** and avoid **impulsive purchases** that go against their financial goals.

#### Spending A.I

This feature will **track** your purchases for the month give **a visualized summary** of the user spending pattern, **progress** towards financial goals, and provide some **insightful spending statistics** to help **review** your financial habits.
